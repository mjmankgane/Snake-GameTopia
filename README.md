Instructions for use (allowable actions): 
-Start by downloading the SnakeApplication.zip file and extract it to save the SnakeApplication folder on your computer. 
-Ensure you have Java installed on your computer.
-Open the computer's Command Prompt Terminal and make sure the local terminal's directory is open within the SnakeApplication folder.
-To run SnakeIsland, in your local terminal, enter the command "java Main" and click the "Enter Snake Island" button to start the game. Use the key "Up arrow" for movement upward, "Down arrow" for movement downwards, "Right arrow" for movement in the west direction and the "Left arrow" for movement to the east. Press any of the four arrow keys to start moving.
-If the snake stops moving, indicating that it is "Game Over", close the window and should you wish to give it another try, simply re-enter the command "java Main" and go for it!

Tools used: 
-Javax Swing
-Java util library
-Java AWT

Concepts used: 
-I used a List to display the growth of the Snake during the game, Custom classes and inheritence to navigate between states of the game, the main concepts that were implemented are the funadamentals of object oriented programnming. All of these concepts can be found in the source code of the game, within the SnakeApplication folder.

Assumptions: 
-Will be used for leisure and as a guideline for beginner programmers on how to build a simple Snake game.

Limitations: 
-The program cannot restart after it is "Game Over" and it only has two windows with a one-way interaction. The program cannot pause and resume in the middle of a game. The snake can only move within a set screen bound.
